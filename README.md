# RateX
The purpose of this project was to create a decentralized open source DEX aggregator on Arbitrum. For complete documentation, take a look at the RateX/docs foler.

To install dependencies for the UI and SDK, posiiton yourself in the root folder (RateX) and run `npm run postinstall`

On the information on how to run the app, take a look at RateX/docs/2_app.md file.

<b>_NOTE:_</b> If app doesn't work, check if your node is running, deployment is good (redeploy with selected network) and if your wallet is connected. _Additional_: Check if your wallet has funds (if not, you have `fundTenderly.js` and `fundHardhat.js` in `contracts/script/utils` that you can run)
